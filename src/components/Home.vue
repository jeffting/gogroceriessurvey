    <h2>About Our App</h2>
    <h3>
      <u>From the ordering groceries standpoint</u>: Go Groceries would act as a home delivery app for groceries. If you've heard of GrubHub or Uber Eats, it's the exact
      same concept, but with groceries. Basically, you would hop on the app, select a store to order groceries from, then select all the
      groceries you want. Within about an hour or less, the groceries would be delivered to your doorstep. You would pay a small delivery fee,
      and given the option to leave a tip.

    <h3>
      <u>From the delivery standpoint</u>: What sets this app apart from
      other grocery delivery services is that the delivery people, just like GrubHub, are regular people that sign up through the app to
      be a delivery person. It isn't the store sending out the deliveries, but rather people working through the app. If I'm a delivery
      person, I could be at home and receive a notification that someone ordered groceries at a store near me. I can choose to pick
      up that delivery, or ignore it. If I accept the delivery, I then go pick up the groceries for the person, and deliver them to their
      door step. I would get paid for each delivery I make, and can choose when I work. This format reduces delivery fees, and offers more options
      of stores that the purchaser can choose from.
